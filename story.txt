This is the story of Fredson DelMar
Who carried with him a fantastic guitar
He played day and night
til it sounded just right
cuz he knew if he did he'd go far.
Far away to claim his fame.
His name will be in lights
and people will shout his name.
He'll be known as DelMar
with the fantastic guitar!
